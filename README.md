# RetrievalToolkit Tutorials

Welcome to the online tutorials for the (RetrievalToolkit)[https://www.github.com/US-GHG-Center/RetrievalToolkit.jl] retrieval algorithm software library. These are a series of online tutorials for interested users of the software library. A basic level of background knowledge of atmospheric gas retrievals is expected, as these tutorials mainly guide users to how the software library is meant to be utilized. Knowledge of the Julia programming language is not necessarily required, in fact some of the tutorials have small sections in them that highlight various features and peculiarities of Julia. Thus, users who have not worked with Julia before will be made aware of potential pitfalls as well as strengths of the Julia programming language.
